I developed a Number Guessing Game🔍 in Java using Swing as part of my Internship with Oasis Infobyte💫. 

Here's an overview of the project:
- Number Generation: A random number between 1 to 100 is generated by the application
- Guesses: Users have 10 chances to guess the number.
- Hints: The application provides hints in four levels - Too High, High, Bit Higher, and Little Bit Higher.
- Score: Players receive a score based on the number of guesses remaining.
- Restart: You can restart the game after winning or losing.
